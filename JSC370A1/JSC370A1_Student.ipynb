    "\n",
    "Li et al. state that \n",
    "\n",
    "> ... literature in the field of innovation shows that the prize-winning works by Nobel laureates tend to occur early within a career, providing evidence of precocious minds that break through in an exceptional way. By contrast, growing evidence shows that ordinary scientific careers are determined by the random impact rule, suggesting that age and creativity are not intertwined, and the most important work in a career occurs randomly within the sequence of works. Second, there is an acclaimed tradition in the history of science that emphasizes the role of individual genius in scientific discovery. However, one of the most fundamental shifts in science over the past century is the flourishing of large teams across all areas of science. This shift raises the question of whether Nobel laureates are unique in being solitary thinkers making guiding contributions.\n",

    "## Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Among Nobel Prize winner's in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, what is the relationship between scientific impact of a paper and the timing of the paper during a scientist's career?  Does this relationship depend on a scientist's age, gender, team size, or prize category?\n",

    "# Presentation Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "The time allotted for each presentation is 7 minutes plus 3 minutes for questions/discussion. This time limit will be enforced. If you exceed the time limit then you will be asked to stop the presentation. This means that you should rehearse your presentation timing before you present to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Presentation Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the presentation is to effectively communicate your findings to a non-technical, but educated, audience (e.g., scientists, physicians, health care executives, company managers, etc.). This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t include technical details, but you should aim to communicate the findings to an audience without a background in statistics, math, or computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to remind us about the project, but only tell us what we really need to know. We are curious about the results, and how you present the results, but they are not the only purpose of this presentation. So, what should you include? Examples, of questions to consider as you prepare your presentation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "What problem did your group set out to solve?\n",
    "How did you group define the problem?\n",
    "What do your results mean in practice? Do your results suggest something should change or not change?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your presentation will be graded using the [presentation rubric.](https://jsc370.github.io/assignment_rubrics.html#presentation_rubric)\n",
    "\n",
    "Presentation slides should be uploaded to Quercus by Jan. 28, 18:00.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Written Report Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "The written report should be done using a Jupyter Notebook or RMarkdown document so that it's reproducible (i.e., we should be able to run the `.ipynb` or `.Rmd` file to reproduce the report). The written report should be at most five pages. This means that you will have to be selective in what you choose to report, and which plots you choose to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answers to Some Common Questions about the Written Report\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not necessary for R/Python code chunks to appear in the report (in R Markdown use the chunk options `echo=FALSE`, `warning = FALSE`, `message = FALSE` and in Jupyter use the command line tool `nbconvert` <sup><a href=\"#fn1\" id = \"ref1\">1</a></sup>) unless there is some part of the code that will contribute to describing what you have done in the data analysis. For example, don’t submit a report with warning messages from a library you loaded in your report. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you will be submitting your R Markdown/Jupyter Notebook file so we can see all the gory details. This leads to …\n",
    "\n",
    "What should be in the report? A high level description of what you have done. This leads to …\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is the intended audience for the report and what do you mean by a “high level description”? The intended audience is an educated person that has taken at least one basic statistics course, but might be a bit rusty on the details. For example, your supervisor at work completed an MBA ten years ago and took a few statistics courses, but the details are a bit hazy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How will my writing be evaluated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your writing will be evaluated for clarity and conciseness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Title [1-5]:** There should be an appropriate title, adequate summary, and complete information including names and dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction [1-5]:** The purpose of the research should be clearly stated and the scope of what is considered in the report should be clear.\n",
